# paysafecard Settlement Report API

# Technical introduction
This document describes the Settlement Report API for business partners of paysafecard.

## About the API
The Settlement Report API can be accessed over HTTPS and informs about all successfully debited transactions (paysafecard and Paysafecash), payouts and refunds.

The data can be filtered by various criteria and the reports are shown as text-file in csv format (Comma-Separated Values).

## Versioning
Every time there is backwards-incompatible change to the API, a new major version will be released. This major version is part of the URL path.
The current major version is *v6*.

You can find details on the version in our [change log](#change_log).

Unless informed by our technical support department that we are dropping support for a particular API version, the business partners do not need to switch API versions.



## Prerequisites
A connection to the API is successful if the following prerequisites are fulfilled:
- API key for request authentification provided by paysafecard per request
- Authorisation of the payment server IP address (if a 403 error is received when trying to access the service, it is likely that the IP address is not yet allowed to access).
- Content-type: Please make sure that the content type in the HTTP header, when submitting requests, is set to **Content-Type: application/json**
- Accept: Please make sure that the accept header, when submitting requests, is set to **Accept: text/csv**
- Character encoding needs to be in UTF-8
- The internet connection (e.g. through firewall) must allow secured HTTP connections (HTTPS)

Connect to our services only via respective FQDNs
Do not cache DNS resolutions of paysafecard FQDNs in your infrastructure (Client servers, Resolvers etc.). The DNS resolutions should expire as soon as the TTL is reached.
In case your application is based on Java, please check your TTL setup on JVM, the DNS caching behavior needs to be adjusted to:
networkaddress.cache.ttl=60 (TTL 60 seconds). Please note that, this parameter needs to be persisted in the JVM security config
If your application is based on any other framework that caches DNS resolution, please make sure to set the DNS TTL to no more than 60 seconds or rely on the TTL set by our DNS records

Honoring DNS changes will make sure that you connect always to our active system.

## API key authentication
Every request to the paysafecard API is authenticated using an API key.
- The value of the **API key needs to be base64 encoded** when transmitted in the HTTP header!
- Set the key as the username. [*HTTP basic authentication*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
- Your API key may only be used from your backend systems.
- *Please note: Your API key must be kept secured - never expose the API key to anybody!*

Below is an example of how the header must to be set.

```

## Endpoint

- https://api.paysafecard.com/v3/reports/

## Limits

- file download: maximum 200.000 downloadable lines
- maximum allowed search with date filter: 12 months at once

## Reconciliation
In the report, only successfully debited transactions (paysafecard and Paysafecash), payouts and refunds are listed. I.e. all transactions settled by paysafecard.
This means that the data for the present day will only be available to be retrieved via the Settlement Report API, on the next day.  

In order to reconcile the invoice sent by paysafecard with the report from this Settlement Report API, just use the stated invoice number from the invoice as a search filter.
